## Welcome!
Since this is the first post, I will try to describe why I decided to start this blog and what will I publish here.


## The origin
A couple of years ago I became interested in the field of machine learning. It truly amazed me that with simple mathematics. You could predict house prices or classify digits without explicitly specifying how to do it.


## Embracing The Feynman Technique
The main idea behind the Feynman Technique is that explaining a (any) concept in simple words forces you to deeply understand the topics that drive this concept. That way it makes it easier to pinpoint any gaps in the knowledge of the topic.

One way to try this method is, of course, to write a blog post about it. The act of writing and editing the post forces the writer to present a topic in the most simple way possible. Plus, it can be seen as an iterative process of decomposing complex concepts into simpler and simpler elements and analogies.


## Let's do it!
And so, this blog is meant to be my journal on the path of data science mastery. I hope that in time I will be able to see any progress in the way I approach the data analysis, the methods I use and how clearly am I able to present the results. See you in the next post.
